## List all variables set in the config file, along with their values.
```
git config --list

```

## Premise
Received the following error during code commit.

fatal: no email was given and auto-detection is disabled

## Solution
This error is due to the fact that thereâ€™s no local user setting found. We need to update this setting which will be used to create logs, on code commit.

Launch Git Bash.
Run the following cmd
```` 
git config --global user.name "your_name"
git config --global user.email "your_email_id"
`````
